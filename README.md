# Electric_car_price_prediction
In this project I scrape electric car data from the Netherlands and update a regression model daily. The data is scraped from autoscout24.nl to get the new listings for today, then the linear regression model is updated and today's prices are predicted with the updated model.

In this project I wanted to learn more about web scraping and this was a nice project to be able to use a model to predict on new data.
